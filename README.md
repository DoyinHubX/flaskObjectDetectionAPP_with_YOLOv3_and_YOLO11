## Flask-Powered Object Detection: Integrating YOLOv3 and YOLO12 for Real-Time Analysis

**Computer vision** is revolutionizing industries, from autonomous driving to real-time surveillance and healthcare diagnostics. One of the most powerful techniques in this field is the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** - a state-of-the-art computer vision framework, known for its speed and accuracy in detecting multiple objects in a single image.

This article guides you through the process of building a Flask-based real-time object detection using both YOLOv3 and YOLOv12. By implementing both versions, you'll gain a broader understanding of the YOLO framework, thereby allowing you to compare performance, accuracy, and efficiency across different YOLO architectures.

The result is a functional Flask Application that not only serves a single YOLO-based object detection, but also allows multiple image uploads, process them in parallel, and download the results as a ZIP file.
